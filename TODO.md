- [ ] Make trimming happen on import?
- [ ] Add more caching
- [ ] Make the app more optimized when selecting stuff
- [ ] Make the frame object be passed in to the packer
- [ ] Find a way to optimize images (half done. uses blobs now)

- [ ] Smart ordered packer, which adds frames below if theres enough space
- [ ] Fix double pack when repacking
- [ ] Make it so the program calculates the padding used, and shows it in repacker
